# Useful English phrases for developers

There're many developers which are not native English speakers (so am I).
The objective of this repository is to help the developers to improve communication skills.

### Topics which I want to cover
- [Names for characters in a keyboard](keyboard-signs.md)
- Computer science terms
- Giving polite comments on code review
- Writing clear comments of git commits
- Debates
- Writing emails
- Daily standups

### Contribution

Feel free to add more content or fix existing using standard fork-pr model.
